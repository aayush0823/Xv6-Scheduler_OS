# PRIORITY BASED SCHEDULER
Prioirity scheduling involves priority assignment to every process, processes with higher priority (having lower priority number between 0 and 100) , whereas tasks with equal priority are scheduled in round-robin our model.

Test-bench named demo.c is designed to compare performance of both schedulers.
